# AdventOfCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the AdventOfCode programming puzzles.

AdventOfCode is a yearly event featuring daily coding challenges, with new puzzles released every December. These puzzles can be found on the [AdventOfCode website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## About

Each year, the AdventOfCode event releases a set of puzzles that test your problem-solving and programming skills. I will be posting my solutions for these puzzles here.

## Repository Structure

- **`inputs/`**: This directory contains the input data for each puzzle.
- **`{numberofday}.py`**: Each day has a corresponding Python script that contains the solution to that day's puzzle. The script is named according to the day number (e.g., `1.py` for Day 1, `2.py` for Day 2, etc.).
