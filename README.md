# AdventOfCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the AdventOfCode programming puzzles.

AdventOfCode is a yearly event featuring daily coding challenges, with new puzzles released every December. These puzzles can be found on the [AdventOfCode website](https://adventofcode.com/).

## About

Each year, the AdventOfCode event releases a set of puzzles that test your problem-solving and programming skills. I will be posting my solutions for these puzzles here.

## Repository Structure

- **`solutions/`**: This directory contains the solution scripts for each puzzle. Each script is named `{numberofday}.py` (e.g., `1.py` for Day 1, `2.py` for Day 2, etc.).
